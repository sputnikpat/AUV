## Introduction

The AUV project aims to create a fully functional autonomous underwater vehicle that can be used for a variety of applications such as underwater exploration, data collection, and environmental monitoring. The vehicle is designed to operate autonomously with minimal human intervention, utilizing advanced algorithms for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and data processing.

## Features

- **Autonomous Navigation:** The AUV can navigate underwater environments using pre-programmed routes and real-time obstacle detection.
- **Data Collection:** Equipped with depth sensor, the AUV can collect environmental data such as temperature, pressure, and depth. It also has camera for real time image processing. I uses Pixhawk as autopilot and uses ArduSub firmware.
- **Real-Time Processing:** The onboard computer Jetson Orin Nano processes sensor data in real-time to make navigation decisions.
- **Modular Design:** The AUV's design allows for easy modification and addition of new components and sensors.

## Installation
